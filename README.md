# WebScrape-Automator
A tool to automate web scraping. In particular, you give it the text you wish to extract, and it will output a line of code to always get that spot in the webpage with simple string manipulations on the html. Good for quick web scrapers that extract a piece of a webpage that changes, such as the height of water on the Columbia River from the surveying website. All you need is the current value, and you will get a line of code that can extract the value of it at the time of running.
